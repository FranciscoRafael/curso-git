Why?
Annually in Brazil about 100,000 children suffer domestic accidents. In addition, there are also cases of kidnapping, theft and violence against children. With that, the creation of a monitoring and tracking system would help parents a lot to monitor their children, besides helping at home to control access to sensitive information on the internet, to control sensors that close doors and windows and turn off electronic products with the intention of preventing domestic accidents.

How?
Use wearables (smartwatch GPS, heartbeat sensor, etc.) to monitor the location, heartbeat, etc. and use them when a problem occurs to send a message to the parents.
Indoors, can use GPS to be able to identify where children are and block a window, block a door, turn off an electrical device, block sensitive content (TV, tablet, smartphone).
