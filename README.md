Waste management using an IOT system to improve the way to dispose and reuse waste.

What ?

Waste management system would be responsible for controlling throughout the process, collection and decomposition of waste in the smart way so that benefit from the waste is maximized. Being able to focus on the process of segregating the garbage in two parts: Firstly, indoors made by people and secondly by society, for example in a condominium, a neighborhood, a city, etc.
House level: 
Intelligent garbage box, which separates biodegradable waste, recyclable waste, toxic waste, etc.
 Use of sensors to check if there is any poisonous gas or poisonous residue and send a message.
 Alert the person if any of the compartments become full.
Society level: 
Automatic garbage separation system (metal, plastic, organic, toxic, etc)
After the separation, direct each type of garbage to the specific collection, in which it checks the quantity in each compartment and activates the collection system (city, neighborhood, etc.) to correctly direct it, for example: Metals for the recycling company, organic waste for the production of fertilizer, etc.


Why?
Waste management is a daily task in urban areas, which requires a large amount of labour resources and affects natural, budgetary, efficiency, and social aspects. Thus, the Waste Management System could help a lot the use of the generated waste, improving the collection system and the recycling system for less impact on nature. In Brazil, 80 million tons of garbage are produced and only about 3% is recycled.
